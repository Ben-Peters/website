    <h2><a name="requirements">Membership Requirements</a></h2>
    <p> An active member needs to actively participate in five (5) events in  three (3) of the areas listed below. Attendance to three (3) consecutive  meetings is also required (unless otherwise arranged). These requirements  must be completed within a single semester.  Having all these requirements  does not necessarily mean that a member will be automatically activated;  each activation will be decided on an individual basis by the exec board. It  is also preferable to have worked at least one (1) L3 or S3 before being  activated.    Active members are eligible to crew chief  events, receive an LnL identification card, and can vote in club  affairs. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p> Associate members have attended at least one meeting and/or worked at least one event.  Associate members may join the <em>lnlnews</em> mailing list to stay informed of events. </p>
