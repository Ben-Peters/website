<h2>Sound</h2>
<div class="threequartercolumn">
 <p>Our sound system can handle anything from a single presenter with a microphone to a full concert. We've done sound for concerts starting in the 70's and have continued to today.</p>
<br />
 <p>Our primary PA system consists of 4 EAW KF850 /SB1000 stacks used for large concerts and outdoor events.  Each stack is individually amped and the system can be broken into two halves to do two simultaneous large events.  Our PA is tuned using a pair of DBX DriveRack digital processing units which when combined give us individual control over each driver in the PA for complete tuning flexibility.  Every time the PA is setup, we tune it to match the room’s current layout, temperature characteristics and the performer’s style.  Combining this PA with our two 40 channel sound boards gives us a very capable system for concerts requiring separate front of house and monitor mixes.  We have a complete suite of monitor speakers and amps and can provide up to 12 monitor mixes if necessary.  </p>
<br />
 <p>A new addition to our equipment, a Yamaha LS9 digital sound board brings LnL sound into the digital age.  This 32 channel board features 16 outputs, with a full suite of compression and equalization for each channel.  It also allows us to sound check multiple bands and seamlessly recall each band’s parameters when they begin their performance.  In addition, it provides a complete host of effects that would normally require bulky equipment and intensive setup. </p>
<br />
 <p>In addition to our large concert setups, we have several smaller sound systems for smaller indoor events.  These systems are interchangeable with each other offering extreme flexibility to closely match the needs of the current event.  The tools we have available to us for these setups include several Allen and Heath 16 channel sound boards and assorted EAW speakers (LA325’s, 128’s, 215’s, 200i’s and others).  </p>
<br />
 <p>To complement these systems, we have a complete suite of microphones for nearly every scenario, from drum sets, to guitars, to pianos, to vocals, we have a microphone perfect for the job.  And of course, we have plenty of cable to connect everything!  </p>
<br />
 <p>With these systems LnL has the flexibility to both put on large, high demand concerts, and the flexibility to run upwards of 5 simultaneous sound events.  Sound is a huge part of what LnL does; if you have any questions regarding what LnL can provide for your event or if you are interesting in finding out more about sound at LnL please e-mail: lnl@wpi.edu</p>
