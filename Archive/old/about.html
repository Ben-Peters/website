    <p>During the winter of 1961-62, five WPI students got together and formed an organization they called Lens and Lights. The first president, Jim Day, named the club after his Weathersfield, CT high school AV club.</p>
    <p>The founding fathers of the club included:</p>
    <p> * Jim Day - Mechanical Engineering, 1965<br />
        * Steve Noble - Physics, 1964<br />
        * John Schmidt - Electrical Engineering, 1964<br />
        * Dave Stone - Physics, 1964<br />
        * Bill Swiger - Electrical Engineering, 1964 <br />

  <p>By 1964, the club had accumulated 25 or so members. They appropriated a space in the basement of Sanford Riley Hall, a building which still serves as a student residence today. Later, we moved our equipment to another storage area on the other side of the same hall, where we still have our main office today. In the picture to the right, Brian Chace '69 runs the old &quot;Green Board&quot; backstage in Alden Memorial Hall. (Over 25 years later, his son David '95 joined LnL and served as Treasurer and President.)</p>
  <p>When they first started, club members got money for equipment through WPI, but not by budgeting. They projected the now infamous WPI recruitment film, Bridge to the Future, and charged the Institute for each showing of the 20 minute reel of 16mm film.</p>
  <p>Over the years, the Club accumulated more equipment and began providing audio and lighting services. Later, they appropriated the projection booth in Alden Memorial Hall and began keeping up the old Simplex projectors in it, left over from Navy recruitment films shown during WWII. Since 35mm was cheaper than 16mm back then, club members taught themselves and each other how to run the projectors and began showing movies on them.</p>
  <p>In 1997, LnL celebrated 35 years of providing the WPI Community with motion picture projection services. To read more about LnL's projection equipment, see our projection pages. </p>
