    <p>One thing that makes LnL so unique is our involvement in film projection. Aside from the standard lighting and sound gigs that we do, we have our own projection booth equipped with the technology to display 16, 35, and 70mm film. Very few schools in the country are capable of displaying 35mm film, while even fewer can show 70mm. Not only does LnL utilize the machines, but they belong to the club and are maintained by the Head Projectionist; a student elected by the general LnL body.</p>

    <h2><a name="16">16mm</a></h2>
    <p>The projection booth in Fuller Labs currently contains two Eiki 16mm motion picture projectors (right). Although these projectors are considered to be pretty high quality in terms of 16mm projection, we avoid using them for full feature movies. Most of the Eiki's life is spent projecting cartoons which we show before movies that we project for the WPI Social Committee. In <span class="quartercolumn"><img src="images/sample.gif" /></span>most cases, these short clips will be of Looney Toons episodes.</p>
    <p>Most people have seen a film projected in 16mm at one point or another. These are typically the clips that you see projected in your high school, or at gatherings for smaller (older) organizations. One upside to 16mm projectors is that they are generallyportable. Ours stay put in Fuller Labs, but they are small enough to be maneuverable, as opposed to our 35mm projectors...</p>
    <p>Despite its desirable size though, we have plenty of reasons why we try and avoid too many 16mm films. First of all, stereo sound processing is not possible with our projectors. Also, due to the decreased frame size, the picture quality is very poor when compared to a 35 or 70mm film.</p>
    <p>When you watch a 16mm film in Fuller Labs you will notice that the picture is of sub-par quality, has very soft edges, and it will appear square on our screen. We only show &quot;flat&quot; films on our Eiki projectors. This means that the picture on the frame is duplicated on the screen, only it's larger. There are (rarely) 16mm prints that are &quot;scope&quot;. Showing scope film requires a special lens to stretch the film out in a particular direction. </p>

    <h2><a name="35">35mm</a></h2>
    <p> As far as projection goes, LnL primarily hosts &quot;P35 events&quot;. That's Lens and Lights talk for a 35mm projection event. Our projection booth is home to two Norelco Todd-AO projectors (right). These projectors are incredible pieces of equipment, and our head projectionist works hard to keep them in perfect running condition.</p>
    <p>We are currently equipped to display 35mm film printed in several different aspect ratios. We have aperture plates and lens's designed for film printed in 1.37:1, 1.85:1, and 2.35:1. In addition, we've been known to fudge other ratio film to run when we're in a jam. The aspect ratio of a film explains the ratio in which it's been printed. The first two ratios listed are both printed in a flat format, and projected directly to the screen. A film printed at 2.35:1 is of a special type loosely referred to as &quot;scope&quot;. A scope image is photographed onto standard 35mm film, but uses a special anamorphic lens. To <span class="quartercolumn"><img src="images/sample.gif" /></span>display a scope film it needs to be projected through another anamorphic lens in your projector. The idea of scope came about in the early 1950's, when TV started to become popular. When scope film is played back you get that nice widescreen effect that people couldn't get at home on their 4:3 television sets. The idea of scope (Initially &quot;CinemaScope&quot;) was developed by the film industry to get people back in the movie theaters.</p>
    <p>In order to operate a 35mm projector in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts you need to have a Motion Picture Operator License. However, if you are Projectionist In Training (PIT), you are allowed to use the projector as long as a licensed projectionist is in the booth at all times. To become a PIT, you simply need to be interested in projection, and speak with the head projectionist. After several training sessions with the HP and practice projecting real movies you may be ready to work towards your license. The standard procedure includes a written examination given by the HP, followed by a hands-on practical. If all goes well in these two areas, the HP can sponsor you for an exam with the Department of Public Safety, which will allow you to obtain your license.<br />

    <p>Most of the movies that LnL projects are for the weekly Sunday night movies hosted by the WPI Social Committee. LnL manages to keep itself busy benching and showing movies for Soccomm, but every now and then we have shows of our own. How often we set up movies of our own depends on member input and motivation, depending on how busy the club is. Movies that we've shown in the past include: Blade Runner: The Director's Cut, The Nightmare Before Christmas, True Lies, Batman, Batman Returns, The Wall, The Meaning of Life, Back to the Future (1-3), Peacemaker, Event Horizon, Clerks, Mallratts, and Deep Impact.</p>
    <p>Most of the films sponsored by Lens and Lights are presented in what we call LnL SenSurround [tm]. This is when we set up most of our equipment in Perrault Hall in an attempt to make the movie-going experience an event to remember. Our latest version of SenSurround [tm] used a total of 27 speaker cabinets. </p>

    <h2><a name="70">70mm</a></h2>
    <p> Lens andLights is one of the few collegiate groups in the country that can project 70mm films. The first and most obvious differencebetween<span class="quartercolumn"><img src="images/sample.gif" /></span> 35mm and 70mm film is that the latter is twice as wide. Also, 70mm film is only available with a magnetic sound track, which produces superior audio quality compared to anoptical sound track what was initially the onlyoption for a 35mm film. Our projectors (shown below) are capable of showing both 35mm and 70mm film strips while only feeding the film through in a slightly different manner.</p>
    <p>Due to the increased size of each from in a 70mm film, a 20 minute reel of 70mm film is about the same size as a 40 minute real of 35mm. This obviously make it more cumbersome to work with, and although it is technically superior to 35mm it isn't used nearly as much (and it generally much harder for us to get a hold of). </p>

    <p>currently use a pair of Norelco AA-II Todd-AO 35/70mm motion picture projectors. These projectors are capable of showing 35mm film with an optical or magnetic soundtrack or 70mm film with a magnetic soundtrack (although our current sound system does not provide the means for processing magnetic sound from 35mm film). They also have the option of showing film at 24 frames per second or 30 frames per second (there were some special prints made in Todd-AO 30fps format).</p>
    <p>The projectors are located in the Perreault Hall projection booth and were donated by the National Amusements Corporation to the Institute. Currently, they are serviced by Boston Light and Sound, Inc. and maintained by the WPI Lens and Lights club. The arc houses on the projectors were manufactured by Christie Electric Corp. and house a 3000 watt Xenon arc bulb.</p>

    <p>We also currently have two 35mm Simplex High projectors left over from the WWII era. Originally, the Navy used the projectors to show recruitment films in Alden Hall. Back in the mid 1960's, Lens and Lights appropriated the Alden projection booth, sound system, and its projectors. LnL members taught themselves how to project, and began using the projectors to show movies every week. Back in the late 1980s, LnL stopped using the projectors in Alden, and when Alden Hall was renovated, power to the projectors was cut, and the booth left unrenovated. Today, the two Simplex projectors are still located in the Alden projection booth. While they have been sitting dormant for almost a decade, the projectors are still in working order.</p>
    <p>Also in the Perrault Hall booth are two Eiki 16mm projectors. We mainly use the 16mm projectors to show cartoon before our movies every week. </p>
