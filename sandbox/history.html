	    During the winter of 1961-62, five WPI students got together and formed an organization 
	    they called Lens and Lights. The first president, Jim Day, named the club after his 
	    Weathersfield, CT high school AV club.	
	    </p>
	    
	    
	    <p>The founding fathers of the club included:</p>
	    <ul style="margin-left:20px;">
	    <li><strong>Jim Day - Mechanical Engineering, 1965</strong></li>
	    <li><strong>Steve Noble - Physics, 1964</strong></li>
	    <li><strong>John Schmidt - Electrical Engineering, 1964</strong></li>
	    <li><strong>Dave Stone - Physics, 1964</strong></li>
	    <li><strong>Bill Swiger - Electrical Engineering, 1964</strong></li>
	    </ul>
	    
	  <p>
	  By 1964, the club had accumulated 25 or so members. They appropriated a space in the 
	  basement of Sanford Riley Hall, a building which continues to serve as a student residence 
	  today. Later, we moved our equipment to another storage area on the other side of the same 
	  hall, which served as our primary office for many years until it was transformed into a 
	  digital music lab in 2009.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	  When they first started, club members got money for equipment through WPI, but not by 
	  budgeting. They projected the now infamous WPI recruitment film, Bridge to the Future, and 
	  charged the Institute for each showing of the 20 minute reel of 16mm film.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	  Over the years, the Club accumulated more equipment and began providing audio and 
	  lighting services. Later, they appropriated the projection booth in Alden Memorial Hall and 
	  began keeping up the old Simplex projectors in it, left over from Navy recruitment films 
	  shown during WWII. Since 35mm was cheaper than 16mm back then, club members taught themselves 
	  and each other how to run the projectors and began showing movies on them.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	  In 2012, LnL celebrated 50 years of providing the WPI Community with motion picture 
	  projection services. To read more about LnL's projection equipment, see our projection pages.
